In stark contrast, Microsoft/Open AI&#39;s recent announcement for Chat GPT 4o was an easy to understand, streamlined, and optimized tool which users can interact with relatively easily across the many Microsoft Office Suite of tools and software. <b><i>ONE</i></b> tool <i>versus</i> 10.<br><br>I believe that what people want more than ever now is clear, concise, honest, simple, and highly cross-functional or multipurpose technology."

These changes will hurt small and medium-sized site owners who rely on traffic for revenue.
